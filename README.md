# [LaserPost](https://nucarve.com/laserpost)
A Fusion 360 CAM post-processor that directly generates LightBurn (LBRN) projects.  All LightBurn configuration is 
maintained in the CAM and post setup, allowing for LightBurn projects to be created with all settings.  Converts CAM 
operations into LightBurn shapes, including support for Ellipse and Path using Bezier curves.  Visit the 
[LaserPost home page](https://nucarve.com/laserpost) for more information.
